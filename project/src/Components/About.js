          <p>Thereâ€™s currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</p>
          <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
            The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, 
            fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, 
            avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</p>
          <p>You can protect yourself and help prevent spreading the virus to others if you:
          Do - 
          Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
          Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
          Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
          Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
          Don't
          Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean</p>
