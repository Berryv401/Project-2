# Groups

The instructor names indicated are those who will be primarily responsible for giving feedback on each project.

These groups were intentionally designed to group together students based on experience and comfort-level through this unit. Our goal is to ensure that each student is working with partners who will face similar technical issues, so they can work together to solve them.
