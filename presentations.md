# Presentations

Each group will present their project to the class starting at **2:30pm on Thursday, Aug 25th**. 

**Each member of the group** must participate in the presentation. 

Following the 10-minute presentation, 5 minutes will be allotted for questions. Take turns answering questions during the Q & A. We suggest the following structure:

- Introduction
  - What's your app called?
  - Who are your group members? Who had which responsibilities?
  - Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"?
- Demonstrating your app
  - What are the **coolest** features of your app?
- Demonstrating your code
  - What was the most difficult part?
  - What did you learn?
  - What are you most proud of?
- The planning process
  - How did you arrive at this idea?
  - How did you decide who would have which responsibilities?
  - What would you change about your planning process?
- The week
  - What was your week like?  
  - Did you feel the Emotional Cycle of Change?
  - How did you work together?
- Highs and lows
  - What worked well?
  - What didn't?
  - What features would you like to add?
